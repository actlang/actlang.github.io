<h1 id="what-does-exo-do">ActLang</h1>

<p>ActLang is a modern functional programming language to build highly distributed applications for BEAM Virtual Machine. Inspired by Erlang's process and Akka Toolkit's Actor-based concurrency model. Actlang is a general-purpose language that makes programming fun and simpler from learning to building enterprise-grade solutions. If you are already familiar with FP paradigm for languages like Haskell, Clojure, Scala e.g, you found actlang easier to start with</p>

<h1 id="background--motivation">Background &amp; Motivation</h1>

<p>A Statically Typed language with all modern features to create stable, less error-prone applications for battle tested Erlang based systems. To make programming easeir for new developers by utilizing the features of functional programming like: </br> Declarative Style ( what, not how) , Functions as first class citizens ( higher-order functions, transformations), immutability, basic algebric data types e.g.</p>

<p>Another goal of actlang is to provide a fantastic developer experience. Simply put, developers should be both highly productive and experience joy when programming. Making them free from the major problem of concurrency: "Shared Mutable State", to build a fault-tolerant system that supports the paradigm: "Let It Crash"</p>

<p>Unlike other programming languages and compilers, ActLang is built around 
the concept of <em>early-compilation</em>. Avoiding programmers to make bad logical mistakes.</p>


<p>We have some talk sessions in plan. When a video of the talk is available,
we will post it here!</p>

<h1 id="getting-started">Getting Started</h1>

<h2 id="setting-up">Setting up</h2>

<p>Working with ActLang is easy! Install the actlang compiler for corresponding OS. currently Unix-based operating systems are the primary focus: MacOS (via homebrew), Linux e.g, but compilation stuff for windows will soon be available. create a file with .act extension and you are ready to complile the code </p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight">
  <code>$ brew install erlang
  $ brew install actlang
</code></pre></div>
</div>



<h2 id="hello-exo">Hello World!</h2>

<p>Let‚Äôs write a hello world program</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code># hello.act

  act Hello {
    // all actions are defined here

    func start() {
        print("Hello World")
    }
  }
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And now we can run the program using actlang compiler:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ actlang hello.act
$ Hello.start()
$ Hello World
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>A beam file is generated in the source directly. *.beam </p>
<p>This beam file is used by BEAM VM to run the program. It is popular for its suitability to build low-latency, fault-tolerant, and distributed applications. </p>


<p>Some of the language semantics are: </p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>
  // variables - type inference
  val x = 1
  > x: Int = 1

  // immutability at the core of the language
  x = 2
  > error: reassigments to an immutable varible x

  // functions are first class citizens
  val areaRectangle(width: Int, height: Int): Int = width * height

  val area = areaRectangle(width: 10, height: 12)
  > 120

  // funcitons that don't return anything
  func doSomething() {
      print("some task...")
  }

  // higher-order functions
  val transform(arr: [Int]): [Int] = {
      arr.map(x -> x + 1)
  }

  > [1, 2, 3] => [2, 3, 4]


  // Hashmap
  val keyValuePairs = ["key": "value"]


  // Custom types, compositions, Algerbric data types:  AND , OR

  type CheckNumber: Int
  type CardNumber: String
  type CardType = Visa | Mastercard
  type Currency = EUR | USD
  type PaymentAmount: Float

  type Payment {
      amount: PaymentAmount,
      currency: Currency,
      cardType: CardType
  }


  val payment: Payment = (amount: 50.5, currency: Currency.USD, cardType: CardType.Mastercard)

  // Asynchrounous operations

  async {
    dosomthing in a different thread / process
  }

  // function to evaluate some result in future
  func doSomething() async {
    ...
  }
  
  // structured concurrency pattern  
  async {
    val result = await doSomething()
  }
  
  // multiple async operations in parallel
  async {
    async val result1 = doSomething1()
    async val result2 = doSomething2()
    val combine = await[result, result2]
  }

  
  
  //Generic functions with possible outcomes
  func getBookingDate(booking: Booking): Either[R&lt;T&gt;, Error] {
    ...
  }

<h1 id="is-exo-right-for-me">Is ActLang Right for Me?</h1>

<ol>
  <li>Are you want to create highly distributed applications without worrying about concurrency</li>
  <li>Are you targeting high performance systems</li>
  <li>Do you need a language to simplify writing complex problems. Integrated with all the modern features of functional stuff</li>
</ol>

<p>If you answered ‚Äúyes!‚Äù, then ActLang might be right for you!</p>

<p>In particular, if you want to work with a large number of independent process unit without sharing state

</br>
  Advantages Of Functional Programming:</br>
Here are some of the benefits of functional programming that are admired by developers. </br>
<ol>
  <li>Shorter code</li>
<li>Easy debugging</li>
<li>Modular</li>
<li>Parallel programming</li>
<li>Increased maintainability</li>
<li>Code readability</li>
  </ol>

Many functional programming languages are in use today in many industries. Actlang purpose is to make this paradigm easier for distribute computing as a general programming language from students to professionals


</p>

<h1 id="-under-construction-">üöß Under Construction! üöß</h1>

<p>ActLang is a young research project and under active development. Here 
are some of the things we‚Äôd like to add / Act (or perhaps continue to learn & explore).</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    Efficient and simpler way to write multithreaded & non-blocking code.
  </li>
  <li>Most appreciateable features from other programming lanaugaes that help us to write better code</li>
  <li>Minimize the compile time, in parallel to show human-readable errors for faster debugging </li>
</ol>

<h1 id="publications--learning-more">Publications &amp; Learning More</h1>

<p>So far, we are going to publish papers & articles on ActLang to get early feedback</p>
