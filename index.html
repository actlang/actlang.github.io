<h1 id="what-does-exo-do">ActLang</h1>

<p>ActLang is an Action-First AI Agent Framework for Building Autonomous AI Agents. An early-stage open-source Agentic framework designed to build highly scalable multi-agents system. Its core is designed to build highly distributed applications for BEAM Virtual Machine. Inspired by Erlang's process and Akka Toolkit's Actor-based concurrency model. Actlang is an Agentic System that makes developing AI Agents, fun and simpler from learning to building enterprise-grade solutions. If you are already familiar with AI Applications, LLMs, and RAG, you found actlang easier to start with</p>

<h1 id="background--motivation">Background &amp; Motivation</h1>

<p>A Statically Typed language with all modern features to create stable, less error-prone applications for battle tested Erlang based systems. To make programming easeir for new developers by utilizing the features of functional programming like: </br> Declarative Style ( what, not how) , Functions as first class citizens ( higher-order functions, transformations), immutability, basic algebric data types e.g.</p>

<p>Another goal of actlang is to provide a fantastic developer experience. Simply put, developers should be both highly productive and experience joy when programming. Making them free from the major problem of concurrency: "Shared Mutable State", to build a fault-tolerant system that supports the paradigm: "Let It Crash"</p>

<p>Unlike other programming languages and compilers, ActLang is built around 
the concept of <em>early-compilation</em>. Avoiding programmers to make bad logical mistakes.</p>


<p>We have some talk sessions in plan. When a video of the talk is available,
we will post it here!</p>


<h1 id="is-exo-right-for-me">Is ActLang Right for Me?</h1>

<ol>
  <li>Are you want to create highly distributed AI-native applications without worrying about concurrency and agent-to-agent communication</li>
  <li>Are you targeting high performance systems</li>
  <li>Do you need an AI Framework to simplify writing complex problems. Integrated with all the modern features of orchestration and multi-agents patterns</li>
</ol>

<p>If you answered “yes!”, then ActLang might be right for you!</br>
In particular, if you want to work with a large number of independent process unit without sharing state
</p>

</br>
 

Many AI Agent Frameworks are in use today in many industries. Actlang purpose is to make this paradigm easier for distributed cloud computing from students to professionals


</p>

<h1 id="-under-construction-">🚧 Under Construction! 🚧</h1>

<p>ActLang is a young research project and under active development. Here 
are some of the things we’d like to add / Act (or perhaps continue to learn & explore).</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    Efficient and simpler way to write agentic multithreaded & non-blocking code.
  </li>
  <li>Most appreciateable features from other frameworks (both pros & cons) that help us to write better code</li>
 
</ol>

<h1 id="publications--learning-more">Publications &amp; Learning More</h1>

<p>So far, we are going to publish papers & articles on ActLang to get early feedback</p>
